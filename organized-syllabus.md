# Open Source Tools For GIS 

## -  Week 1 and 2
#### Code Academy
* Complete Units in the Course Academy [Javascript coursework](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
  - Introduction to JavaScript
  - Variables and data types
  - Control Flow
  - Functions
  - Scope
  - Arrays
  - Loops
  - Iterators

## -  Week 3
#### 1.Section 1: Using functions (liberally!)
* Function anatomy
  - Naming/defining functions vs calling functions
  - Providing arguments
  - The function body
  - The `return` statement
* Thinking functionally
  - Programs are data and its transformations
  - Functions are just transformations on data
  - Functions as values
#### 2.Live coding: refactoring code into functions
* Step through the code and discuss
* Imagine alternative code flows
* Organize the code
* Make code DRYer ('don't repeat yourself')
    - Redundant code is a headache to maintain

    - Forms
- Carto

## week 11


### SQL Related
- SQL with CartoDB
  - Manually writing SQL for analysis
  - Always:clap:use:clap:the:clap:SQL:clap:console:clap:
  - SQL [types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype.html), special Carto columns, and PostGIS [types](https://postgis.net/docs/reference.html#PostGIS_Types)
  - [Creating new
    tables](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/wiki/creating-tables-though-the-SQL-API)
  - Results as GeoJSON
- SQL Resources
- Examples
  - Torque for time series
  - SQL for persisting data changes, interaction, and GeoJSON

### PostgreSQL & PostGIS Resources
#### GIS Extension Related
> Good

- [PostGIS special function
index](https://postgis.net/docs/PostGIS_Special_Functions_Index.html)
- [PostGIS reference docs](http://postgis.net/docs/reference.html)
- [Stack exchange's GIS-specific subdomain](gis.stackexchange.com/)

#### Examples

[CartoDB Torque](./examples/torque/)
Torque.js is an open source library for creating dynamic visualizations for
your time series data on top of Leaflet (and with the help of CartoDB).
If you're dealing with time and space, Torque can build compelling
visualizations ranging over both dimensions.


[CartoDB SQL API](.examples/writing-data/)
> Keeping API keys in client applications is NOT a safe practice.
> Do NOT use the techniques from this lab in the wild.

## Week 12

- GeoJSON and SQL through CartoDB
  - REMINDER: Always:clap:use:clap:the:clap:SQL:clap:console:clap:
  - You can use a REST client like
    [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Advanced REST
Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US)

- Carto Input/Output
  - [Result formats](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/making-calls#response-formats)
  - [Carto backed maps](examples/carto)

- [SQL Performance](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/query-optimizations)
  - Ask for only the columns you need
  - [Geometry simplification](http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_Simplify.html)
  - [Indices](http://revenant.ca/www/postgis/workshop/indexing.html)
  - [Save work in new tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-createtableas.html)
  - [Force CARTO to recognize new tables](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api/creating-tables/)
  - Use the `cartodb_id` in queries (this column is indexed by default). Example:
```SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  <TABLE>
WHERE
  cartodb_id = <some_id>
```

- Rasters
  - Tiling for TMS
  - PostGIS analysis (this is painful - I've always avoided it and you should too)
  - Alternatives


- Extras:
  - [Fast spatial joins on the frontend with rtrees](https://beta.observablehq.com/@jfrankl/spatial-search-with-flatbush-and-leaflet-draw) (demo by Jeff Frankl) Note that these joins work with bounding boxes rather than complex shapes
  - [Working with topojson](https://beta.observablehq.com/@jfrankl/topojson) (demo by Jeff Frankl)
  - [Project work by the creator of Leaflet](https://github.com/mourner/projects) Quoting Jeff: "*rbush* can handle points and rectangles and can be updated, *flatbush* is faster than rbush but is static (canâ€™t be updated with new geoms), *kdbush* is the fastest but is only for points"
