# Open Source Tools For GIS 

## -  Week 1 and 2
#### Code Academy
* Complete Units in the Course Academy [Javascript coursework](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
  - Introduction to JavaScript
  - Variables and data types
  - Control Flow
  - Functions
  - Scope
  - Arrays
  - Loops
  - Iterators
  - Objects
  

## -  Week 3
#### 1.Section 1: Using functions (liberally!)
* Function anatomy
  - Naming/defining functions vs calling functions
  - Providing arguments
  - The function body
  - The `return` statement
* Thinking functionally
  - Programs are data and its transformations
  - Functions are just transformations on data
  - Functions as values
#### 2.Live coding: refactoring code into functions
* Step through the code and discuss
* Imagine alternative code flows
* Organize the code
* Make code DRYer ('don't repeat yourself')
    - Redundant code is a headache to maintain

## -  Week 5  
  
#### More developer tools
  - Viewing/playing with HTML and CSS in `elements`
  - 'Breakpoint debugging' in `sources`
  - Viewing data transfer in `network`
- Homework/lab discussion
  - Thinking through asynchronous behavior and scope
  - Walk through async code example
  - Walk through CSS/HTML example
- Thinking of functions in terms of what they do vs what they are
  - `return` statements
