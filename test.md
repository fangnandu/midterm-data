## -  Week 3
#### Section 1: Using functions (liberally!)
* Function anatomy
  - Naming/defining functions vs calling functions
  - Providing arguments
  - The function body
  - The `return` statement
* Thinking functionally
  - Programs are data and its transformations
  - Functions are just transformations on data
  - Functions as values
#### Live coding: refactoring code into functions
* Step through the code and discuss
* Imagine alternative code flows
* Organize the code
* Make code DRYer ('don't repeat yourself')
    - Redundant code is a headache to maintain
#### underscore.js
